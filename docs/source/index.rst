Welcome to iamsystem's documentation!
======================================

iamsystem is a Python library for **semantic annotation**, a.k.a entity linking.
The algorithm tries to find the keywords you are looking for in a document and it was created to do so quickly
even if the dictionary size is large.

You will learn how to annotate documents with this algorithm, namely how to add
keywords and how to bring matching flexibility by handling abbreviations,
inflected forms (singular, plural...), typos, stopwords and discontinuous sequences of tokens.
